add the variable MARLIN_GUI to your environment and set it to 1 (see line below) and compile Marlin as usual
export MARLIN_GUI=1

if everything went fine you should have the binary Marlin_GUI in you bin directory.

NOTE:

Please take into account that if you build Marlin with new Processors after having compiled the GUI they won't be
recognized in the GUI until you recompile the GUI again. (Sorry for this inconvenience)
