    Hitting this during running will run the end routine for each processor and then exit Marlin, 
    allowing you to stop event processing and still preserve histograms/results/etc. 
    ( A bug in LCIOOutputProcessor leads to a memory error on exiting, but has no impact 
      on anything else )

        allows to restrict the collection that are read from the 
        LCIO file(s) to the ones given 
        ( needs LCIO v02-04 )

      - new command line option (H.Perrey, DESY):
         -u : consistency check and updated version of xml file

     std::terminate/std::unexpeted (machine dependent and not compatible with ROOT)
   - fixed DEBUG printouts in startup phase (e.g. Marlin -x ...)


# v01-02-01
      - bug fixes: 
           - fixed new streamlog levels DEBUG5-DEBUG9, MESSAGE5-MESSAGE9,....ERROR9
	   - local streamlog level was not used in modifyEvent() and modifyRunHeader()
 
# v01-02
     - made command line options case sensitive

     - check spelling of command line options
       and enforce that parameters are present
       in steering file

     - increased verbosity threshold levels - added:
       DEBUG5-DEBUG9, MESSAGE5,....,ERROR9

# v01-01

    - Added dynamic command line options (see example by calling Marlin -h)
    - Added checking of duplicate processor entries in the steering file

    Bug fixes:
        - skip loading of duplicate lcio libraries/headers from lccd (cause warning on mac osx)
        - examples/mymarlin/src/MyProcessor.cc: protected against non-existing collections
        - made gcc 4.4.3 compliant
        - removed compiler warnings

# v01-00

        - Added a global random seed for Marlin processors. 
          This is used to provide individual pseudo-random numbers to Processors on
          an event-by-event and run-by-run basis. These may be used by Processors to 
	  seed their random number generator of choice. In order to use this service 
	  a Processor must register itself in the init method using:

                Global::EVENTSEEDER->registerProcessor(this);

          and should retrieve its allocated event seed during processEvent using:

                int eventSeed = Global::EVENTSEEDER->getSeed(this);

	  and include the header file:

	  	#include "marlin/ProcessorEventSeeder.h"	      	

          The global seed is used for a complete job and is set in the Global steering parameters thus:
        
                <parameter name="RandomSeed" value="1234567890"/>

          Note that the value must be a positive integer, with max value 2,147,483,647
          A pseudo-random event seed is generated using a three step hashing function of unsigned ints,
	  in the following order: event_number, run_number, RandomSeed. The hashed int from each step 
	  in the above order is used as input to the next hash step. This is used to ensure that in 
	  the likely event of similar values of event_number, run_number and RandomSeed, different 
	  event seeds will be generated. 
       
	  The event seed is then used to seed rand via srand(seed) and then rand is used to 
	  generate one seed per registered processor.

	  This mechanism ensures reproducible results for every event, regardless of the sequence 
	  in which the event is processed in a Marlin job, whilst maintaining the full 32bit range 
	  for event and run numbers.
          

        - allow RunHeaders to be modified in EventModifier interface 
	  (https://jira.slac.stanford.edu/browse/MAR-35)


	- added ./test directory with some initial marlin tests
          (use make test to run the tests)

        - improved CMake files and build procedure

            - added MarlinConfig.h to include general purpose configuration definitions
            - removed deprecated build mode: MARLIN_NO_DLL


 
# v00-13

        -  added macro streamlog_level( MLEVEL ) for use in if() statements with VERBOSITY, e.g.
          if( streamlog_level( DEBUG ) && x ) {
            // do additional computation
            // ...
            streamlog_out( DEBUG ) <<  ....
          }

    level, one of DEBUG, MESSAGE, WARNING, ERROR 

  - optionaly a working directory ($MARLINWORKDIR) can be used to build
    Marlin and dependend packages (in packages directory) 
    if not set $MARLIN will be used

  - added support for cmake (experimental) 

  - support for runtime plugins (experimental) 
    shared libraries with processors that are specified in	
    $MARLIN_PROCESSOR_LIBS (comma separated list of full-paths to libs) 
    are loaded at program start up	



# v00-09-06

 - first release of MarlinGUI that helps to create/modify xml steering files
   interactively -> see $MARLIN/gui/README for details

 - new methods Processor::registerInput/OutputCollections() 
   for checking consistency 

 - new feature 'Marlin -c steer.xml' checks steering file
   for consistency (names and types of LCIO collections (author J.Engels) 

 - new feature 'Marlin -f old.xml steer.xml ' adds LCIO collection
   type information to old xml steering file for usage with Marlin -c

 - new feature 'Marlin -o old.steer steer.xml ' 
   convert old (deprecated!) steering file to xml steering file
     (you can also use the GUI to read in old steering files)


 - switched to  latest version of tinyxml:  2.5.2


# v00-09-05

  - introduced bool processor parameters
  - allow to skip first N events (global parameter: SkipNEvents) requires LCIO > v01-05
  


# v00-09-04

  - made compliant for use with RAIDA 
  - no new functionality, only minor fixes and documentation


# v00-09-03


 - beta code for split files if given size exceeded in LCIOOutputprocessor

 - bug fix in LCIOOutputprocessor for DropCollectionNames


# v00-09-02

  - updated documentation

  - some code cosmetics


# v00-09-01

 
  first usage of GEAR
  
  introduced userlib.gmk for USERINCLUDES and USERLIBS

# v00-09

  added Exceptions and Exception handler that prints error message when an
  uncaught exception is thrown

  added SkipEventException and StopProcessingException to skip the current 
  event or all following events 

  improved makefiles for Marlin:
     -	src/GNUmakefile creates marlin_includes.sh and marlin_libs.sh
        in order to build with the same libraries as have been used for 
        core Marlin
     -  new top level GNUmakefile that builds marlin together with 
        user packages containing processors in $MARLIN/packages
     -  modified example makefile for user packages
        $MARLIN/examples/mymarlin/src/GNUmakefile

  new (optional) XML steering files that provide new features:

     - conditions: Processor::processEvent will be called only if a condition
       expressed in terms of ProcessorNames as specified in the steering file is true

     - groups: processors can be grouped together so that they can share common variables
       and can be referred to in the <execute/> tag by the group name

     - TinyXml parser ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyxml ) 
       that can be used to read arbitrary xml files

  create example steering files:  
    ./bin/Marlin -l > example.steer 
    ./bin/Marlin -x > example.xml 

  LCIOOutputProcessor allows to drop collections - needs LCIO v01-05

  new method Processor::isFirstEvent() - use instead of static bool isFirstEvent

  added SimpleFastMCProcessor - simple smearing Monte Carlo - see fastMC.steer for an example

  new DataSourceProcessor class that allows reading of non-LCIO data streams
 
  StdHepReader processor that creates an LCIO data stream from an stdhep file
  (patch by J.Samson for limiting the number of events (MaxRecordNumber))

  bug fixes:
   empty lines containing whitspaces or tabs are ignored now (no seg.fault)
   processors end() method now called in reverse order of initialization !

# v00-08

  improved API doc
  
  bug fixes in ConditionsProcessor

  improved example/mymarlin/src/GNUmakefile

# v00-07
    
  added ConditionsProcessor for LCCD
   
  added optional parameters to Processor
 
  read chain of LCIO input files in Marlin.cc
   
  fixed problems with registered vector parameters

# v00-06

  added examples directory that can serve as a template for user projects

  added Processr::printParameters()
 
  fixed Problem with default values of parameters 

  renamed Processr::dump() to Processr::printDescription()

# v00-05

  added Processr::check()  to be used for checkplots in reco processors
 
# v00-04    (changes wrt. to v00-03):
  
   * generates warning instead of error message if less than MaxRecordNumber records read

   * improved handling/documentation of steering parameters / modules

     - Marlin -l : lists all kown modules and their steering parameters
		   with description and default values
                   in a format that can be copied to a  steering file 

       -> use Processor::registerProcessorParameter(name, description, parameter, defaultVal ) ;
          to declare your parameters

     - leading whitespace allowed in steering file to improve readability


   * new AIDAProcessor for producing AIDA/root histograms:

    - handles AIDA file for all modules 
    - modules simply create and fill their histograms
    - uses JAIDA/AIDAJNI AIDA-implementation 
    - not mandatory - could still use root but preferred  for 'official' processors/modules
