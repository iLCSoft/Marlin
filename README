* Marlin is a simple framework that could serve as the basis 
* for the FLC software that deals with LCIO files, e.g. reconstruction
* and analysis code.

The idea is that every computing task is implemented as a processor (module) that analyzes 
data in an LCEvent and creates additional output collections that are added to the event.
The framework allows to define the processors (and their order) that are executed at runtime in a 
simple steering file.
Via the steering file you can also define named parameters (string, float, int - single and arrays)
for every processor as well as for the global scope.
By using the framework users don't have to write any code that deals with the IO they simply 
write processors with defined callbacks, i.e. init(), processRunHeader(), processEvent(), end().

To build the marlin library without any existing packages:

   #-- modify env.sh according to your system  and requirements
   . env.sh
   gmake -C ./src

To build the API documentation with doxygen
   gmake -C ./src doc


  +++ (NEW since v00-09) +++
You can also build Marlin together with existing packages that contain Marlin processors. Simply 
copy the corresponding packages to the ./packages subdirectory (or use a symbolic link to reference
an existing package directory)  and use the top level makefile:
   . env.sh
   gmake 
   
This works if the packages in the ./packages subdirectories fulfill the following requiremets:

   a) they have the following structure
         ./MyPackage/include
         ./src/
         ./src/GNUmakefile
         ./lib
   b) a call to gmake lib creates:
         ./MyPackage/lib/libMyPackage.a

   c) all package dependencies have been added to the user section of the top level makefile !!

To develop your own processors and create applications:

  - Inherit from Processor and overwrite the needed methods (init(), processRunHeader(), 
  processEvent(), end()).

  - provide default constructor that initializes the Processor with a type name (typically the class name)
    and one globale instance of your class, e.g. 

     TestProcessor aTestProcessor ;
     TestProcessor::TestProcessor() : Processor("TestProcessor") {}

     this makes your processor known to Marlin.


  - Create the steering file - either old ascii format or new xml format:  

    old ascii format:
    -----------------
    * start from test.steer and add sections for every needed processor (use ./bin/MyMarlinApp -l 
      to get example sections for all known processors)
    * Add your processor(s) to the variable ActiveProcessors with a unique name.
    * Add a section with the processor parameters to the steering file (identified by the unique name)
    * Don't forget the parameter ProcessorType (typically the class name)
 
    -> run: './bin/MyMarlinApp test.steer'


  +++ (NEW since v00-09) +++

    new XML format:
    ---------------
    * create an example steering file with ./bin/MyMarlinApp -x > test.xml
    * edit the <execute/> section by adding processors as needed (use the names 
      defined in the corresponding <processor/> tag.  

    -> run: './bin/MyMarlinApp test.xml'

    * XML files provide a mechanism to group processors and to define conditions for the 
      execution of the processors (see API doc of class XMLParser for details)

 -> examples/mymarlin can serve as a template for a new project using marlin !

    simply copy the whole directory 

       cp -r $MARLIN/examples/mymarlin MyMarlinPackage   (please choose another name !)
 
    renaming the files source files, e.g.

      mv include/MyProcessor.h include/ChooseAReasonableNameForThisClass.h
      mv src/MyProcessor.cc src/ChooseAReasonableNameForThisClass.h

    edit the makefile src/GNUmakefile:

       PROGNAME = MyMarlinPackage (please choose another name but the same as above for the package ! )

    add external libraries as needed to the user section:

    ifndef USERINCLUDES
      USERINCLUDES = -I ../../MarlinCommon/include  
    endif

    ifndef USERLIBS
      USERLIBS =  -L ../../MarlinCommon/lib -lMarlinCommon
    endif
   
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Note: the structure of this makefile has been changed in  v00-09 to make it easier to integrate 
     the various marlin based packages. The ifndef/endif construct allows to build this package locally
     as well as from the top level makefile !
     So please consider to upgrade your existing marlin packages' makefiles.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  set the proper environment - edit env.sh and then
     . env.sh 
  build the example 
     gmake -C ./src
  
  Or copy the (link) directory and build together with Marlin and other packages  using the top level 
  makefile as described above.
     

If you are updating from an older version please also read the ./doc/release.notes and the latest version
of the API doc !
