* Marlin is a simple framework that could serve as the basis 
* for the FLC software that deals with LCIO files, e.g. reconstruction
* and analysis code.

The idea is that every computing task is implemented as a processor (module) that analyzes 
data in an LCEvent and creates additional output collections that are added to the event.
The framework allows to define the processors (and their order) that are executed at runtime in a 
simple steering file.
Via the steering file you can also define named parameters (string, float, int - single and arrays)
for every processor as well as for the global scope.
By using the framework users don't have to write any code that deals with the IO they simply 
write processors with defined callbacks, i.e. init(), processRunHeader(), processEvent(), end().

To build marlin:
   export LCIO=$MY_PATH_TO_LCIO
  
   #modify aid_env.sh according to your system    

   . aida_env.sh

   gmake -C ./src

To build the API documentation with doxygen
   gmake -C ./src doc



To develop your own processors and create applications:

  - Inherit from Processor and overwrite the needed methods (init(), processRunHeader(), 
  processEvent(), end()).

  - provide default constructor that initializes the Processor with a type name (typically the class name)
    and one globale instance of your class, e.g. 

     TestProcessor aTestProcessor ;
     TestProcessor::TestProcessor() : Processor("TestProcessor") {}

  - Edit the steering file:   
    * Add your processor(s) to the variable ActiveProcessors with a unique name.
    * Add a section with the processor parameters to the steering file (identified by the unique name)
    * Don't forget the parameter ProcessorType (typically the class name)
 
  - run: 'myexecutablename myparameters.steer'


 -> examples/mymarlin can serve as a template for a new project using marlin !

    simply copy the whole directory and edit (after renaming) the files
     src/MyProcessor.cc
     src/GNUmakefile
     include/MyProcessor.h 

   modify and source  env.sh to set the proper environment
     gmake -C ./src
   builds the example 
       
  
If you are updating from an older version please read ./doc/release.notes.
